# Mobile Devices: P1 - App Screen Design
## Guidelines

This task is individual, and aims to make a Flutter app with a single screen that shows the details
of an object. If possible, this task will be part of the next one, where we will make an entire app that
will use the developed screen now.

The type of item to display must be something you like: books, recipes, music groups, pets,
movies, songs, handball equipment, clothes, excursions, etc. For once, we'll avoid video games.
The important thing is that everyone takes something different. If you pick something that you think other people might pick,
ask first, no same or even similar apps allowed.

### 1. Search for a design

You have to go to a design website (Dribbble, Behance, Mobbin) and search for a mobile design. (Sign up
to be able to access the images.) The design cannot be a list of elements, it must be a screen that shows
the details of a single object.

### 2. Implement the app

Create a class in Dart (which we call the model) to store the necessary data. The widget it represents
the screen must use the Dart object with the data to fill each element on the screen, since if we pass
different objects, the screen must display different data. Use provider to make the data visible to everything
the widget tree. The screen must be as faithful as possible to the original design, without obsessing about it
all details are correct (this can be too difficult, ask if in doubt).
